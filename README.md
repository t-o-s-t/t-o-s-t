welcome to you,i'm t-o-s-t.
I'm a learner to seek everthing of the world. exploring the composition of the world is really extremely  excited me .
the structure of the world looks like that it‘s someone setted. with developing of Quantum mechanics,you will find 
that many things are not as we thought.
there many wise people here,i can get what i want to know, maybe the answer is right or wong,but it doesn't matter.
that's enough to inspire me .
if you were too, i would be very appreciate.
